Welcome to Dradis
=================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradisframework.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradisframework)

Dradis is an open source framework to enable effective information sharing, 
specially during security assessments.

Our goals:

* Share the information effectively.
* Easy to use, easy to be adopted. Otherwise it would present little benefit over other systems.
* Flexible: with a powerful and simple extensions interface. 
* Small and portable. You should be able to use it while on site (no outside connectivity). It should be OS independent (no two testers use the same OS).

Some of the features:

* Platform independent
* Easy report generation: in Word, HTML, etc.
* Markup support for the notes: styles, images, links, etc. 
* Integration with existing systems and tools:
  * [Burp Scanner](http://portswigger.net/burp/scanner.html)
  * [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/)
  * [Nessus](http://www.nessus.org/products/nessus)
  * [NeXpose](http://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose-community-edition.jsp)
  * [Nikto](http://cirt.net/nikto2)
  * [Nmap](http://nmap.org)
  * [OpenVAS](http://www.openvas.org/)
  * [OSVDB](http://osvdb.org)
  * [Retina](http://www.eeye.com/products/retina/retina-network-scanner)
  * [SureCheck](http://www.wildcroftsecurity.com/)
  * [VulnDB](http://vulndbhq.com)
  * [w3af](http://w3af.sourceforge.net/)
  * [wXf](https://github.com/WebExploitationFramework/wXf)
  * [Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)


Getting started (stable release)
--------------------------------

In http://dradisframework.org/downloads.html you will find a Windows installer
and .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 packages.

Uncompress, verify and prepare the environment:

    $ tar xvvjf dradis-vX.Y.Z.tar.bz2
    $ cd dradis-vX.Y/
    $ ./verify.sh
      # follow instructions / install dependencies
    $ ./reset.sh

Once the environment is ready, you can start the server with:

    $ ./start.sh

And browse to https://localhost:3004 to start using Dradis. If you need to bind
to a different address (so others can connect to your instance) or another port
number, you can use the -b and -p switches respectively:

    $ ./start.sh -b 10.0.0.123 -p 443


Getting started (git release)
-----------------------------

First, clone the repo:

    $ mkdir dradis-git
    $ cd dradis-git/
    $ git clone https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework.git server

Then download the verify, reset and start scripts to your dradis-git/ folder:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/verify.sh
    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/reset.sh
    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/dradis/meta/master/start.sh
    $ chmod +x *.sh
    $ ./verify.sh
      # follow instructions / install dependencies
    $ ./reset.sh

Dradis runs on top of Ruby on Rails so you need an extra step to make sure all
the JavaScript files and stylesheets are served swiftly:

    $ cd server/
    $ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
    $ cd ..

Once the environment is ready, you can start the server with:

    $ ./start.sh

And browse to https://localhost:3004 to start using Dradis.

If you would like to make Dradis accessible to other people on the network:

    $ ./start.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -p 443

The `-b` option defines Dradis' bind address and the `-p` option can be used to change the port.

Duo Security
------------

Duo Security provides two-factor authentication to Dradis. In addition to the shared password, each user can have a Duo Security account which will individually authenticate their user using
a software (Push, SMS, Phone Call) or hardware (Token) integration.

To create a Duo Security account, visit `http://www.duosecurity.com/pricing` to sign-up and then visit `http://www.duosecurity.com/docs/getting_started` to learn how to setup a WebSDK integration.
The preferred deployment of this integration would be allowing only pre-configured users to utilize Duo Security, rather than user enrollment which would allow anyone to setup a Duo Security user.

To enable Duo Security in Dradis, edit config/duo.yml and configure all of the parameters listed for your WebSDK integration once you have users configured.
